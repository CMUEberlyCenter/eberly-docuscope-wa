    overview: You may lose <b>clarity</b> if you try to pack too many ideas into a
      sentence.
    description: This panel displays each of your sentences as a sequence of noun
      phrases appearing before and after the main verb. Focus on the sentences with
      many noun phrases before the main verb but also after. Click on the sentence
      line on the left to see your actual sentence.
    read_aloud: Read the sentence aloud when feeling. If you stumble or run out of
      breath, you are most likely stuffing too much information into a single sentence.
    passive: There is nothing wrong with <b>be verbs</b> to signal "existence". But
      an overreliance on the <b>be verbs</b> can result in weak writing. If you find
      you have too many <b>be verbs</b>, try to revise some of the sentences with
      <b>active verbs</b>.

  description: The Coherence Panel charts the flow of your topic clusters across and
    within paragraphs. Dark circles indicate that a particular topic cluster is prominently
    discussed in a particular paragraph. White circles and gaps indicate that a particular
    topic cluster is mentioned but not prominently or not mentioned at all in the
    paragraph. Study the visualization for dark/white circles and gaps and see if
    the shifts in topic clusters and their prominence fits a writing plan your readers
    can easily follow.
