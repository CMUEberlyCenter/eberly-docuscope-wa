  details:
    overview: You may lose <b>clarity</b> if you try to pack too many ideas into a
      sentence.
    description: This panel displays each of your sentences as a sequence of noun
      phrases appearing before and after the main verb. Focus on the sentences with
      many noun phrases before the main verb but also after. Click on the sentence
      line on the left to see your actual sentence.
    read_aloud: Read the sentence aloud when feeling. If you stumble or run out of
      breath, you are most likely stuffing too much information into a single sentence.
    passive: There is nothing wrong with <b>be verbs</b> to signal "existence". But
      an overreliance on the <b>be verbs</b> can result in weak writing. If you find
      you have too many <b>be verbs</b>, try to revise some of the sentences with
      <b>active verbs</b>.
