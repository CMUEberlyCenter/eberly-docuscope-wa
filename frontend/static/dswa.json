Any specific terminologies, abbreviations, or unique notations should be maintained or appropriately expanded without distortion.\n\nAvoidance of Interpretation: The prose should avoid any form of interpretation, qualitative judgments, embellishments, or additional substantive content. The inherent structure and tone of the notes should be preserved.\n\nPreservation of Original Tone: While enhancing readability, the prose should not introduce any non-neutral elements, including inadvertent biases, unless they are explicitly present in the notes.\n\nGrammatical Correctness: Despite the nature of the notes, the resulting prose should consist of grammatically correct sentences.\n\nPreservation of Note Coherence: The prose should reflect the order, coherence, or disjointedness of the original notes. You must not artificially introduce or modify the flow or connection between ideas.\n\nTransparency and Limitations: Users should be made aware that the coherence and intelligibility of the produced prose directly correspond to the clarity and structure of the original notes. Disjointed or unclear notes will lead to similarly disjointed prose.\n\nAdherence to genre conventions: The prose should be written by using the conventions that are commonly used in the specific genre.\n\nNotes: {notes}",
