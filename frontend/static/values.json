   "coherence": "<body>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:600;\">Coherence</span> refers to the flow of topics in a written text. Topics that are repeated across sentences and paragraph are thought to be \u201cmain\u201d topics that help readers understand what the writing is about.</p>\n<p>In this auditing panel, if you have a draft, you can view the topical flow of your draft. If you organize topics by count, you will see the topics that get repeated most across paragraphs and sentences. You can check to see whether the topics you think are most important to your writing are in fact getting the most \u201cstage time\u201d in your draft.</p></body>",
   "clarity": "<body>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:600;\">Clarity</span> means that your sentences are easy to comprehend and don\u2019t exhaust readers. Clarity often depends on the background of the reader. Readers with high knowledge of a subject find sentences clear that readers with low knowledge do not. While clarity is often relative to reader background, there are objective markers of clarity as well. Sentences that get to the main verb early tend to be clearer than sentences that delay the main verb for a long time. Sentences with a long delay of the main verb strain the reader\u2019s memory. Sentences that make their point not too long after the main verb tend to be clearer than sentences that dribble long after the main verb. Sentences that never seem to stop also exhaust readers.</p>\n<p>In this auditing panel, you can check all your sentences for how long you make the reader wait before they hit the main verb and how long you keep your sentence going after they\u2019ve hit it. Time length is in this case is measured in terms of the number of noun phrases (green boxes) you\u2019ve created before and after the main verb. If you have more than three boxes to the left of your verb and five boxes to the right, your sentence may be putting undue strain on your reader. Think about shortening it and watch how DocuScope reduces the number of boxes to the left or right of the verb before your eyes.</p></body>",
   "impressions": "<body>\n<p><span>When writers write, they create meaning they control. But they also create </span><span style=\"font-weight:600;\">impressions</span><span> they may or may not control. We can spot a writer who is \u201cintellectual\u201d or \u201cinformal\u201d, \u201coptimistic\u201d or pessimistic\u201d, a \u201cstory-teller\u201d or a \u201creporter\u201d. When we write, readers are bombarded by the impressions we give off.</span></p>\n<p><span>In this auditing tool, you can see maps of the impressions your draft is giving off to readers. Don\u2019t immediately judge the impressions you give off. Try to understand them and see if you can explain them. If you are writing a letter to the editor and you find that you are coming across as \u201cnegative\u201d and \u201cangry\u201d, see if this impression makes sense to you. Consider if it is effective. If so, fine. If not, you may want to revise, return to this tab, and see if you\u2019ve removed some of the anger.</span></p>\n<p></p></body>"
